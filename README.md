# -WIP-Stock-Support-Resistance-Generator
Stock support/resistance line generator primarily using yfinance and plotly python packages.
This project is still in it's very early stages and will grow along with my knowledge on the stock market and trading strategies.

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Run the program by typing "python main.py" in the project directory
2. Enter a stock ticker when prompted
3. Enter a date in MM-DD-YYYY format when prompted 
!(Make sure date entered was an open market day within the last 30 days (No weekends/holidays))
4. View the resulting 1 minute, 2 minute, and 5 minute charts for that day in the browser popup creatly by plotly.
